# facenet-face-recognition

This repository contains a demonstration of face recognition using the FaceNet network (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf) and a webcam. Our implementation feeds frames from the webcam to the network to determine whether or not the frame contains an individual we recognize.
